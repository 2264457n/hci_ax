<h5>Mental health issues affect one in four people, and according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/"> World Health Organisation</a>, treatments are available, but almost two-thirds of people never get help from a professional. This page was created to help understand the availability of mental health services globally, as well as to be able to compare the availability in countries in the same regions. </h5>

<h5>Mental health issues, by definition, are non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and often correlate with other NCDs, like obesity and respiratory conditions. This page will be updated with statistics about other non-communicable diseases, in order to be able to analyze the data and show the correlation between these NCDs and mental health disorders.</h5>
